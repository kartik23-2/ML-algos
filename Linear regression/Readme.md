### Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous outcome variable (Y) based on one or more input features (X).

It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

##  Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
 Definition-->

Uses one independent variable to predict the target variable.

 Example-->

Predicting salary from years of experience.

 Visualization

A straight line best fitting the data points in a 2D graph.

## Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
 Definition-->

Uses two or more independent variables to predict the target variable.

 Example-->

Predicting house price using area, number of bedrooms, and age.

 Visualization-->

Represents a plane (or hyperplane) in higher dimensions (not easily visualizable beyond 3D).
