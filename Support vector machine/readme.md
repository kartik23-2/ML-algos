## Support Vector Machine
the main idea is to amximize the distance of training and and testing points from the hyperplane that is classifying in order to have wide range of classification for the new unseen data points.

1. we find the hyperplane on each side as parallel to main classifying hyperplane with the first '+ve' & '-ve' points on each side.
2. the distance between those 2 hyperplane is called margin(d) 
3. we find the hyperplane with that max value of margin(d).
